A primary goal of the restoration project will be to expand learning opportunities for students and visitors to campus.
We envision that the space will inspire outdoor exploration, connections to natural environments, and help to develop a 
strong a sense of place. To  achieve these  goals  the  site  will  include  outdoor classroom spaces, informational kiosks,
and other related opportunities. Outdoor classrooms will be available for instructional use, as well as a place for students
looking to find a place to study. Kiosks, placed across the landscape, will provide information about the history of the land,
its current state, and ongoing research projects. This minimal infrastructure will maintain a low profile on the natural landscape
and will allow for both active and passive learning oppor-tunities.
